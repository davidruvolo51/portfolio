# My Portfolio

Repo for [davidruvolo51.github.io/portfolio/](https://davidruvolo51.github.io/portfolio/)

## Getting started

You will need to install [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/). I would also recommend installing [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/en/) as well. Afterwards, clone this repository and install the packages.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/davidruvolo51/porfolio
cd portfolio
pnpm install
```

*Note*: If you are using regular `npm`, use `npm install` instead.
